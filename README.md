# Data-Packs
This repository contains all of CallMeKFC's public data packs.

You can download them, and play with them all you want. Please note that these packs should ONLY be used in 1.16-1.17.1.

To learn what the packs do visit my wiki page: [https://github.com/CallMeKFC/Data-Packs/wiki/Explaining-The-Data-Packs](url)

Please make sure to credit me if you use one of my packs.

If you want a custom pack developed, then join [https://discord.gg/nAcpcHEjRs](url) and make a request in #requests!

Thats all for now! Enjoy the packs!
